Java implementation of the dcpu-16 CPU for 0x10^c. Contains:

- Programmatic assembler
- Disassembler
- Command line debugger with stepping functionality
- Emulator

The code is not my finest work due to the limited amount of time
i put into it. I appreciate any pull requests send in my direction.
The programmatic assembler should serve as the basis for a high-level
compiler for a variant of PL/i.

All of the code is Apache 2 licensed, the sample in data/ is taken
from Notch's dcpu-16 spec and is assumed to be public domain.

To see each piece at work, check the corresponding class (Disassembler,
Assembler, Debugger, Cpu) and their respective main method.
